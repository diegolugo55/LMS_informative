            <h3>Why the App?</h3>
            <p>
                There is a need for farmers to modernize the way they recollect livestock data. In many farms the workers still use physical books to recollect their data. This is not a bad thing, but it is not efficient. This new way to recollect the data needs to take into account the unique weather conditions, species, and policies of Puerto Rico, etc. It also needs to be minimalistic and easy to use. Many times employees may find themselves with an overlap in activities, such as having to move the livestock from one location to another, but the veterinarian comes to check in on the livestock. For such situations, there is a need for a way to prioritize tasks and there is also a need for a way to notify farmers/employees when tasks or activities are close due.

                <h3>LMS</h3>
                <p>
                    The LMS (Livestock Management System) will embody a platform hosted on the web where users (mostly farm owners) will be able to manage their livestock by recollecting their data. Such as how many animals of each species are there on the farm, when is the next vet appointment, if they have been fed or not, etc. It is a minimalistic, very easy to use application for the convenience of the users. The main objective is to help improve the farmers ability to manage their livestock. Especially Puerto Rico farms. The platform will be useful to any farm owner that wants to manage both their livestock better. It will also be useful to anyone developing a farm. As a simple to use LMS as we have envisioned will be of help to anyone getting into the business. Specifically, the system will allow users to view how much stock of each specific race is there in the farm.

                <p>
                    Also, statistics will be available for long term data, such as the lifespan of every species due to their living conditions, and short term data, such as how much is being spent on food or maintainance. In addition, the platform will have a calendar available for employees and farmers to see due tasks or activities throughout the day, month or even throughout the year and mark them done when completed. To use the LMS you must have access to a stable internet connection and a mobile device or desktop to be able
                    to connect to a web browser such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Safari to login to the application. This project is also useful for members of the team that do not have experience with front-end development, back-end development or even attaching the back-end logic with the front-end. In this way, the project allows for the individual academic and professional knowledge of each member to expand.
